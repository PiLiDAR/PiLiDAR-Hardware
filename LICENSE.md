## Additional Commercial Use Rights for Backers:

Backers who support this project through specific funding platforms 
may be granted the following limited commercial use rights:

**Permitted Commercial Use**: Backers are allowed to build and use the PiLiDAR device for commercial services such as offering 3D scanning as a service. 
They may not sell, license, or distribute the device or modified versions 
of the hardware/software as a commercial product.

### Restrictions:

**Prohibition on Product Sales**: Backers are explicitly prohibited from manufacturing 
and selling the PiLiDAR device as a product or derivative product without the express

**Attribution and ShareAlike**: Any modifications made by backers to either the software or hardware must:

Provide appropriate attribution to the original creator.
Be distributed under the same CC BY-NC-SA license, meaning that modifications and derivative
